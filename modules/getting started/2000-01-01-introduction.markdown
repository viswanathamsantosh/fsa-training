# Welcome to the FSA Beginner's Guide!

Hi there! So we heard you just became a Firefox Student Ambassador. Congratulations! You are now part of a passionate, unconventional, smart, fun, and incredible group of students out there changing the world. Before we get started with any FSA-related activties, let's get you equipped with the basic things that you need to  know about Mozilla and the FSA program.

We start with the Beginner's Guide, the basic guide that all FSAs must read. It is split into 5 parts: **learning about Mozilla**, **knowing Mozilla's projects and products**, **knowing the FSA program**, **connect with us through the FSA communication channels** and **how to get involved with Mozilla beyond the FSA program**.

## Speak up!

At Mozilla, speaking up your mind is vital in ensuring that we activate healthy participation. If you have any questions or suggestions about the things presented here for your learning, don't hesitate to:

Discuss at the [FSA Discourse forum](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/firefox-student-ambassadors)
